# AutomatedFaceRecognitionSystem

Introduction:
The project is about the attendance management idea using face recognition technology which 
will replace the manual method of taking attendance and also overcomes difficulties in 
maintenance. The proposed system requires no papers and no attendance registers. All it needs is 
a camera and an algorithm that runs on the photo that is captured that recognises all the faces 
which are trained with the algorithm prior to the implementation of the system. The system 
updates an excel sheet that stores the attendance of students in a class everyday and every period.
Since this a view of practical implementation , the algorithm is implemented using python since 
a high rate of accuracy is anticipated.

The proposed automated attendance system requires sound knowledge and skill in the following 
areas that belong to the field of Computer Science like Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing, 
Deep Learning and Python . This system can maintain the attendance up to date and it can be 
retrieved whenever required just by accessing the recorded data in the form of excel sheet. This 
also overcomes issues like noting the data incorrectly , proxy attendance and errors in manual 
updation to a greater extent and can also reduce the time and work required to analyse or report 
the status of attendance of students.
